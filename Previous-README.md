This is a restatement of https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/PhotoPainter_(B)?srsltid=AfmBOorJ3bLfb7Pt-J-9MdHltMDTrVcoOKM2IHJRmpZxPlMtm0LQb1jJ#Overview

Note: Photopainter(B) uses a RP2350 mcpu. That means we use the pico sdk and cross compiles and packages up to a uf2 file system on SD card image. That image file is flashed onto the photo frame device.
It came from https://github.com/waveshareteam/PhotoPainter_B.git

Photo files are different.  They need to be the correct size and format and copied to an SD card. The are sample images in PhotoPainter-B/B_MP. There is a converter program for Mac (its Python and a bash script)
